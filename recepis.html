          The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French
          dish make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin
          with a roast pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h1>Ингредиенты:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced into rings</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      </ul>
<div class="Spisk_1">
      <h1>Шаги:</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart
          casserole dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole
          dish; season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then
          top with with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in
          flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor
          has cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a
          time, whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual
          addition and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5
          minutes. Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted,
          30 to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the
          dish with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is
          bubbly, about 1 ½ hours.
        </li>

        This is a wonderful pineapple dish to be served with ham. It is a favorite at Easter in my family. The egg whites add a touch of lightness to it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Ингредиенты:</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs, whites and yolks separated</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
      <li>3 cups cubed bread</li>
  
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F 175 degrees 
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat the egg yolks, sugar, butter, and milk together in a large bowl. Stir in the pineapple and bread. Lightly fold egg whites into the pineapple mixture, then spread the mixture into a large baking dish.


      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.
